## intro
+ When have to work with function representing polynomial, e.g. plot polynomial function, the function can be made by summing all terms manually (Imam, 2018).
+ To calculate $f(x)$ for single value of $x$
+ User defined class can be constructed to meet only what is needed, coffecients, string representation in LaTeX, and calculate the value for every $x$ using callabes (Klein, 2023).
