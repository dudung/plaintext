## intro
+ The term graphical method in finding root might have lots of meanings as follow.
  + The graphical method can also be presented in the form of perpendicular segements representing polynomial coefficients in the process of finding the real roots of pthe polynomial (Eisenberg, 1967).
  + For complex roots the graphical method perform the analysis in the form of contour in complex plane (Pfeiffer, 1979).
  + There is also other graphical technique for nonlinear algebraic equations that employs two graphs of the zero-curves of the real and imaginary parts of the polynomial for locating roots approximate location (Mitsui, 1983).
  + Not to related to topic covered here, graphical study in the other form, e.g. polynomiography, can be very helpful in studying the newly development of root-finding algorithm (Naseem et al., 2023).
+ In this note the meanings of the graphical method are limited only to the following.
  + Graphical method is classified as bracketing methods in root finding methods, which is not very percise (Hedge, 2015).
  + It is used usually to find real roots of an equation (Vaniya, 2020).
