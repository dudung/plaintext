## intro
+ When writing a function in Python it is often required to pass values to the function, where this values are called function arguments, which can be in fixed or dynamic numbers (Krishna, 2022).
+ There two types of argument passed to function in Python, which are positional and keyword arguments (Wilkinson, 2023).
+ One of the reason Python programming languange, which is known for being simple and readable, is its way of handling parameters in very easy and dynamics way using `*args` and `*kwargs` (Bolanle, 2023).
+ Due tue not aware of all possible use cases of a code, and to offer more options for future programmers working with the module or for users interacting with the code, passing a variable number of arguments to a function can be accomodate using `*args` and `**kwargs` (Tagliaferri, 2021).
+ In the Python documentation about its functions it is common to see `*args` and `**args` defined as parameters in some functions, which is a major cause of confusion for most Python programmers (Pykes, 2022).
+ There are some combinations of normal positional arguments and normal keyword arguments that are working, which can be easier to understand by trying them yourself (Gruppeta, 2022).
